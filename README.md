General Assembly's 2 Day Airline Booking System challenge

![Burning Airlines Quick Demo](https://res.cloudinary.com/mrmy/image/upload/v1517886258/ba-demo-faster_kpnymb.gif)

The task: To build an airline booking system using a front-end framework only recently taught in class (React) and your own Rails API.

2 days, 2 people, first ever project in React.

### Built with:

- React v16 (this repository)

- Ruby (2.4.2) on Rails (5.1.4) - we built a separate admin site/API to interact with our 'customer' UI. That repo lives [here.](https://github.com/madeleinemila/burning-airlines-backend)

- HTML5 / CSS3



### Check it out live at:

### Some improvements if this became a real app:

- Implement full-featured secure logins - the current pseudo-login method was for demonstration purposes.

- Implement dynamic flight path info - for our demo we hardcoded the imaginary Burning Airlines flight paths, but this could be changed to get updates from the database of any path the administrators entered.

- Pull the 'Existing Reservations' component up to the top level of the user page. During the challenge we popped it in the reservations section that appeared after choosing a new flight to book, but in a real implementation this would make more sense at the top level.
